  <title>Day 2: Confronting vulnerability overload with risk management</title>
<body>
<p>Welcome back!</p>

<p>For day 2 of the StackAware vulnerability management course, we're going to look at
how to tackle the problem of vulnerability overload we explored in <a
href="https://vuln-exchange.github.io/stackaware/5_day_course/day_1.html">day 1</a></p>

<p>It all begins with a risk-based approach.</p>

<h1>Vulnerability management is risk management</h1>

<p>If patching software or otherwise fixing a vulnerability is easy to do, then just
do it! No need to worry much about prioritization if it's as easy as updating your iPhone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for most businesses, it's not this simple.</p>

<p>Legacy applications, complex tech stacks, and concerns about downtime mean that you
can't constantly be updating every system in your network. So you need to make tough decisions.</p>

<p>The key here is trading off risk vs. reward.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities can create the risk of suffering a data breach or other cybersecurity incident.
But your business needs to make revenue (the reward), so you usually can't
knock a critical system offline to patch everything immediately.</p>

<p>Understanding which of the four risk management <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/the-four-horsemen-of-risk-management">actions</a>
(mitigate, transfer, avoid, and accept) makes the most sense requires an
understanding of the financial value to be gained (or preserved) in each case.</p>

<p>That's where quantitative analysis comes in; you need to put a dollar value on the
risk posed by each vulnerability.</p>

<p>Attackers don't care how many &quot;criticals&quot; you remediated this month and neither
should your business leadership. So take CVSS and just throw it out the window right now.</p>

<p>If you absolutely insist on using a non-quantitative approach, then check out <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/a-somewhat-dreadful-vulnerability">DREAD</a> or the Microsoft SDL <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/hurdling-the-bug-bar">Bug Bar</a>.
But I won't be going deep on these in this course.</p>

<h1>The cyber risk management formula</h1>

<p>There are many different ways you can get the financial value of a vulnerability and
there are already some great existing frameworks such as the <a
href="https://www.fairinstitute.org/">FAIR</a> and the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Cybersecurity-Risk/dp/1536669741">Hubbard/Seiersen</a> approach.</p>

<p>While these techniques are relatively complex, you can really <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/how-much-will-exploitation-of-a-critical">boil</a>
them down to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Annual
risk = annual frequency of cyber incident happening x financial impact of it
happening</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>A more technical way of saying this is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Annual
loss expectancy (dollars per yer) = annual rate of occurrence (number of times
per year) x single loss expectancy (dollars)</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>To abbreviate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ALE
($/yr) = ARO (times/year) x SLE ($)</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Note that ARO can (and generally should be!) less than 1, indicating that most
incidents happen less frequently than once a year.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is possible to break down SLE further:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SLE
= asset value ($) x exposure factor (percentage)</span><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p> Beacause not every attack or event would necessarily result in the complete loss of an
asset, we may need to scale the SLE by an appropriate value. That's the
exposure factor. This will come into play in the next lesson when looking at
some more advanced methods for calculating risk.</p>

<h1>Applying this to the real world, and a caveat</h1>

<p>&quot;So what do I do with this formula?&quot; you might reasonably ask.</p>

<p>I agree that the devil is in the details with these types of things, so stay
tuned for the next lesson. In it, I'll explore three different methods for
implementing it in real-world situations.</p>

<p>Before then, though, I need make an important point. Critics of quantitative cyber
risk management will often say &quot;there are too many unknowns to make a
numerical estimate.&quot; And while there are certainly things we can't know,
we do know some things for certain.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228</a>
(log4shell, probably the worst security vulnerability in history) is more
likely to be exploited in the wild than <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8283">CVE-2017-8283</a>
(which cannot be exploited in the default configuration of Ubuntu, where it is
often found).</p>

<p>If you have a problem with that statement, then I'm not sure what to tell you.
Because you must also believe that there is no way to calculate the odds of getting abducted by aliens on the way to work vs. arriving safely after your
morning commute.</p>

<p>My point here is that, yes, of course there is uncertainty. And no, we won't be
able to make risk predictions with complete accuracy. You should hedge
appropriately when communicating with others, making clear that what you are
providing is an estimate. This is important when dealing with skeptics who will
claim you are implying an unrealistic level of precision.</p>

<p>Both the <a href="https://www.fairinstitute.org/">FAIR method</a> and <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Cybersecurity-Risk/dp/1536669741">Hubbard/Seiersen</a> approach use more advanced methods of statistical
modeling such as the Monte Carlo method to better represent this uncertainty.
And you should by all means read their books if you have the time.</p>

<p>So know that, while I absolutely admit that the techniques I am recommending are
not perfect, they are <i>good enough </i>for the vast majority of situations.</p>

<p>And certainly better than the status quo of CVSS.</p>

<p>So catch you tomorrow!</p>
