<p>Welcome to StackAware's vulnerability management course!</p>

<p>Over the next few days, we'll dive deep into one of the major security problems
facing organizations today: dealing with known vulnerability overload.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we're going to take a look at the problem, and hopefully, show
that you aren't alone in your struggles.</p>

<h1>First, a definition</h2>

<p> By known vulnerabilities, I mean those which a network defenders could reasonably
be expected to know about through some sort of scanning tool or manual
analysis. Check out this <a href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/3rd-and-greater-party-code-risk-managing">post</a> for details, but know that this excludes &quot;zero days&quot; (at least prior
to their public announcement) and other situations where an attacker is theonly one who knows about the flaw prior to exploitation.</p>

<p>You'll need to use other techniques (like penetration testing) to find unknown
vulnerabilities, and they are certainly important as well. But this course
focuses on the known type.</p>

<h1>There is a massive quantity of known vulnerabilities in most networks</h1>

<p>A 2022 <a href="https://resilientcyber.substack.com/p/youre-vulnerable-and-malicious-actors">report</a> from Rezilion and the Ponemon Institute surveyed over 600 IT/Security professionals and 66% said they have a backlog of more than <i>100,000</i> open vulnerabilities. And over 50% of security leaders admitted they were able to patch <i>less than 50%</i> of their backlogged vulnerabilities. I know of networks with millions.</p>

<p> Dozens of new CVEs (just one type of known vulnerability) are <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard"> style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>reported
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a> every day in the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD). And there is a huge chunk of known issues that
don't even <a
href="https://flashpoint.io/blog/cve-nvd-failed-to-report-and-detail-27-3-of-vulnerabilities-in-2022-h1/">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>get reported style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
there.</p>

<h1>Exploitability of known vulnerabilities is difficult to gauge</h1>

<p> Many, if not most of the entries in the NVD are &quot;<a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/confronting-mark-curpheys-critiques">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>science projects style='font-size:
1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>&quot; that were exploited under very narrow
circumstances by researchers. As a result, multiple studies suggest that <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/but-is-it-exploitable">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>90% style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
or more of CVEs aren't exploitable in a given configuration.</p>

<p>While most application security <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/application-security-tools">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>tools style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
generally can't determine exploitability, they <i>will </i>generally flag
libraries and components that have known vulnerabilities in them. This makes
the signal-to-noise ratio very low and wastes valuable time on the part of
informations security teams (e.g. you!) who need to triage a lot of issues that
present very low risk.</p>

<h1>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a broken industry standard</h1>

<p>In addition to the fact that most vulnerability scanner findings aren't
exploitable is the unfortunate reality that the way they are scored - generally
with the CVSS - does <a
href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/cvss-an-inappropriate-industry-standard">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>not style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
make sense.</p>

<p>Many organizations use a strategy of prioritizing &quot;high&quot; and
&quot;critical&quot; findings (meaning they have a CVSS score of 7.0+) for
remediation and leaving other issues for later (or never fixing them at all).</p>

<p>Despite

style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>many style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a><a

style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span> organizations style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>,
including the one that <a href="https://www.first.org/epss/model">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>created style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
the CVSS and the <a

style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>United States Government
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>, pointing out that this strategy is
highly counterproductive, many security teams continue to pursue it or even
demand their vendors do the same.</p>

<h1>Enterprises are overwhelmed</h1>

<p>Prior to being breached in 2017 via <a
href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/equifax-apache-struts-vulnerability-cve-2017-5638/">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>CVE-2017-5638 style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>,
for which it was fined <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/equifax-pay-575-million-part-settlement-ftc-cfpb-states-related-2017-data-breach">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>$575 million style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>,
the credit monitoring company Equifax was using manual, <a
href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FINAL%20Equifax%20Report.pdf">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>email-driven style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
processes to prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation. It also had a backlog
of over 1000 known vulnerabilities on <a
href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FINAL%20Equifax%20Report.pdf">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>internet-facing style='font-size:
1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a> systems <i>alone</i>. At the time of the breach,
Equifax's market capitalization was over <a
href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/equifax/marketcap/">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>$17 billion style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>

<p>Let that sink in: a deca-billion dollar company safeguarding incredibly sensitive
data was struggling to manage its vulnerabilities so much it was eventually
breached by one known to be exploitable...<a
href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/massive-equifax-breach-caused-by-failure-to-patch-two-month-old-bug/">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>two months style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
after being publicly announced!</p>

<p>But the thing is, this isn't rare at all.</p>

<p>According to one research study, most organizations appear to have a &quot;<a
href="https://securityscorecard.pathfactory.com/risk-intelligence/cyentia-fast-and-frivolous">
style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>natural limit style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>&quot;
of being able to remediate only 10% of the total vulnerabilities in their
network each month. So almost no organization, irrespective of size, will be
able to just &quot;fix everything.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see, basically everyone is dealing with vulnerability overload. And
considering that attackers begin <a

style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>exploiting style='font-size:1.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></a>
known vulnerabilities almost immediately upon publication, this means that <i>prioritizing</i>
effectively is the single most important task in vulnerability management.</p>

<p>We'll look at how to do this beginning with Day 2's lesson.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
