<title>Day 4: Building a vulnerability management policy</title>
<body>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Welcome to Day 4!</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">And here's Day 3's <a href="https://vuln-exchange.github.io/stackaware/5_day_course/day_3.html">content</a> in case you missed it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">In this lesson we are going to look at how to operationalize the formulas we discussed in the past two days: via a vulnerability management policy (VMP).</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">A VMP should be one of several security policies that your organization maintains. At a high level, it explains your approach to managing the risk created by vulnerabilities in a clear and unambiguous manner.</p>

<h1>Components of a policy</h1>

<h2>Risk appetite</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This is the organization's baseline tolerance for cybersecurity risk, and should be annotated in terms of
dollars per year. Many VMPs I have seen don't explicitly state a risk tolerance but rather make it implicit 
by allowing certain types of issues (e.g. CVSS &lt; 4.0) to not be remediated.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">You should make clear what your risk tolerance is, though. Otherwise there is no way to be consistent and logical about what the right tradeoffs are to make (which is the whole point of this exercise, right!?).</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Furthermore, if you are really sophisticated, my recommendation would be that you establish a cumulative risk tolerance for <i>all</i> vulnerabilities, rather than treating each one individually. Check out this <a href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/managing-your-risk-surface">post</a> for a detailed discussion, but know that such a total "risk surface" calculation is an advanced technique.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Below I'll give an example of a simpler, vulnerability-by-vulnerability approach to defining risk appetite.</p>

<h2>Risk tolerance</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This represents the organization's desired velocity for returning to the risk appetite once exceeding it. Again, optimally this would be calculated cumulatively across the organization, but doing so might be too much for your current maturity level. So in that case, I would give the below as an example timetable identifying the organization's risk appetite and tolerance:</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>The product-line general manager shall ensure remediation of vulnerabilities within the following timelines:</i></p>

<ul>
 <li><i>&lt; $10,000 ALE | 90 days</i></li>
 <li><i>$10,000-$49,999 ALE | 60 days</i></li>
 <li><i>$50,000-$99,999 ALE | 30 days</i></li>
 <li><i>$100,000+ ALE | 15 days</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk acceptance authority</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This is the person accountable for ensuring the organization stays within its risk appetite and tolerance,
and who is authorized to accept residual risk above the designated amount. This should be a business leader
with complete responsibility for the company, product line, or subset thereof. This is often the Chief Executive Officer
, General Manager, Chief Product Officer, or Chief Information Officer.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Whenever this person does approve risk outside the appetite or tolerance, he should document this fact in writing and designate an <a href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/reviewing-palantirs-vulnerability">expiration</a> date for the approval when it must be re-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Policy approver</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">The individual who authorizes the policy in the first place, and has formal authority to direct the risk acceptance authority.
These two roles may be the same person. This is generally a:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Chief Executive Officer;</li>
  <li>Chief Information Officer; or</li>
 <li>Product-line General Manager</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Advisor</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">This is the company’s primary cybersecurity risk advisor. This should be a technical specialist who has the expertise to advise on the likelihood of a given risk materializing and the impact of it occurring. 
 This is often the:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Chief Technology Officer;</li>
  <li>Chief Information Security Officer; or</li>
 <li>Head of Information Security</li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">This person should NOT be under the direct authority of the risk acceptance authority. Whenever faced with a risk acceptance decision, the risk advisor shouldn't feel the need to "pull punches" when making his recommendation regarding the impacts of such a decision. It's up to the risk acceptance authority to make the tough calls based on the information presented.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">General drafting best practices</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Always include the 5 Ws</b> (Who, What, Where, When, and Why) in the policy section. For example: “product-line general managers shall ensure the remediation of vulnerabilities in their respective products exceeding $10,000 of annual loss expectancy within 90 days of identification to ensure conformance with the company risk appetite."</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Leave no wiggle room</b>. This means never use the passive voice (e.g. “vulnerabilities must be remediated”) and always identify a single accountable party, by job title. Additionally, use words like “shall,” “must,” and “always” rather than “should” or “generally.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Include disciplinary/remediation steps more detailed than just “non-compliance may result in termination”</b> (although of course include this). A mandatory root cause analysis (RCA), sponsored by the manager of an employee out of compliance, can ensure that leaders take responsibility for training their people. Breaching a threshold of a certain number of non-compliance incidents in a given timeframe should trigger organization-wide retraining, because clearly people haven’t gotten the message.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Don't include security release criteria in your vulnerability management policy.</b> The former type of policy handles an entirely different type of risk and you should tailor it narrowly to the appropriate circumstances. Check out this <a href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/security-release-criteria">post</a> for more information, but suffice to day, DO NOT include something like “No software should be deployed to production with unresolved high or medium findings" in your VMP.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">I would also highly recommend you check out this <a href="https://www.blog.deploy-securely.com/p/vulnerability-management-policies">post</a> on the top 10 recommendations for structuring your program if you have time. It gets more in the weeds about implementation details and is a great companion resource to this course.</p>

<h1>Moving forward</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">So what does a good policy look like?</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">I'm happy you asked.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">StackAware has a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/194oI79wIpXFfOEhVye8OW4wmHQxYHSO9/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=110873095006072629293&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">template</a> that you can copy directly from Google Drive.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">It's appropriate for a more mature organization and might be too much for your team if you are just getting started. With that said, feel free to use it as a starting point.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">If you are getting to this point and thinking to yourself "how does this all work in practice?" then I have an answer for you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Because you have gone through my course and are set up for vulnerability management success, I want to give you a discount off the StackAware Vulnerability Management SOP.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">An action-driven playbook that you can start using immediately, it will save you hours of time and confusion when setting up your program.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Check out the details <a href="https://sop.vulnerability.management/l/buy">here</a> and use code VULNMGMT.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">In any case, I'll see you tomorrow for the final day of the course!</p>
