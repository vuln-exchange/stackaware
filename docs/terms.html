  financial, or any other nature, disclosed in any manner, whether verbally, electronically, visually, or in a written or other tangible form, which is either identified
  or designated as confidential or which should be reasonably understood to be confidential.</p>

<p>The Party disclosing Confidential Information under this Agreement is the “<span class="caps">Discloser</span>,” and the Party receiving the Confidential Information is the “<span class="caps">Recipient</span>.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Exclusions.</strong> Confidential Information does not include information that:
    <ul>
      <li>is or becomes public without breach of the terms of this Agreement by Recipient;</li>
      <li>was in Recipient's possession or was known by Recipient prior to its receipt from Discloser that is not under an obligation of confidentiality;</li>
      <li>is or becomes available to Recipient without restriction on use or disclosure from a source already in legitimate possession of said Confidential Information, such source being other than Discloser;</li>
      <li>is developed independently by Recipient without the use of Confidential Information; or</li>
      <li>is disclosed for unrestricted release with the written approval of Discloser.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use and Duration.</strong> During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years from the expiration or termination of this Agreement, 
    Recipient must not disclose Confidential Information of Discloser for any purpose except as contemplated under this Agreement,

  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>AI Processing.</strong> Recipient may process Confidential Information using machine learning or artificial intelligence (“<span class="caps">AI</span>”) 
    systems so long as Recipient obtains commercially reasonable assurances the resulting AI model is not both:
    <ul>
      <li>trained on Confidential Information; and</li>
      <li>lawfully available to any person or entity aside from Discloser, Recipient, or Representatives of Recipient.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> Recipient will not be liable to Discloser for disclosure of Confidential Information if Recipient is obligated to 
    disclose the Confidential Information by order or regulation of any governmental entity so long as Recipient has given timely notification, to the extent 
    it is permissible under the circumstances, to Discloser prior to the date of disclosure and Recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential 
    treatment of the requested Confidential Information.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Remedies.</strong> Each Party recognizes that the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information could cause irreparable injury 
    to the party to whom it relates. Each party agrees that the party injured or who might be injured by unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information 
    will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies and damages available, to seek a temporary injunction to restrain violation of this Agreement by the other party 
    and its agents, representatives, and employees.
  </li>

  <li>

    Customer’s Confidential Information (“<span class="caps">Usage Data</span>”) to provide and improve the Services and provide insights, service and feature 
    announcements, and other reporting. Provider owns Usage Data and may use it for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement, including 
    without limitation to develop and improve Provider products and services and to create and distribute insights, reports, and other materials.
  </li>

   or development of Provider’s Offering.</li>
 <li><strong>Ownership of Professional Services Deliverables.</strong> Contingent on Customer’s satisfaction of the payment terms in the relevant Order Form, 
  Provider agrees that all Professional Services Deliverables will be the sole and exclusive property of Customer. At that point,

  </ul>

<h2>10. <span class="caps">Miscellaneous</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Independent Contractor.</strong>  Provider’s relationship with Customer will be that of an independent contractor acting as a service provider to Customer, and not that of an employee, worker, agent, or partner of Customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign the Agreement without the other’s consent, except either party may assign to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the assignee assumes all obligations. Any prohibited assignment is void.</li>
  <li><strong>Notices</strong>. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing. All such notices will be sent to the email addresses set forth above or to such other email addresses as may be specified by either party to the other party in writing.

In the case of Delivery Failure, notice will nevertheless be deemed to have been received when originally sent by email if no more than 7 days later the sender delivers a tangible copy of that notice to the recipient’s mailing address. 7 days after the sender of a notice receives an Out of Office Response from the recipient, it will be deemed to have been received.

  <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement, and any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, including its breach or termination, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, without reference to conflict of laws principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Amendments</strong>. Any amendment to this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing, identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement, 
    and is signed by the Parties (<span class="caps">"Amendment"</span>). The Order Form may, by referring to specific sections or provisions of these Terms, amend them.  
    Each party agrees that it will have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation based on any provision of this Agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement, constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter 
    and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to its subject matter. 
    This means, for example, Customer must not ask Provider to sign any further non-disclosure, intellectual property assignment, or business associate agreements separate 
    from this Agreement, Amendments to the Agreement, or any executed Order Form.
  <li><strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law.</li></strong>
  <li><strong>Electronic signatures</strong>. Except where prohibited by law, the Parties consent to use electronic signatures to execute this Agreement and agree that such signatures are valid and binding on the parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar days</strong>. References to days in this Agreement are to calendar days.</li>
  <li><strong>Publicity.</strong> Provider may identify Customer by name and logo (which Provider will use in accordance with Customer's commercially reasonable brand guidelines) as a customer.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Survival.</strong> This entire section will survive the termination of the Agreement.
  </li>
</ul>
