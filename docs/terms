It Affects Your Legal Rights.</p></li><li><p>This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p></li><li><p>This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND STACKAWARE AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. </strong>For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to cure or resolve the dispute.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>This must first done by emailing us at legal@stackaware.com the following information:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>your name,</p></li><li><p>your address,</p></li><li><p>a written description of your claim, and</p></li><li><p>a description of the specific relief you seek.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Arbitration Procedures. </strong>Any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, or breach or termination thereof, will be finally settled by binding arbitration in Delaware, United States pursuant to the International Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by a single JAMS arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving complex commercial contract disputes. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will apply Delaware law to the merits of any dispute or claim, without reference to rules of conflict of law, and shall have the authority to award any and all available remedies, including legal and equitable relief. The parties may apply to any Delaware court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without any abridgment of the powers of the arbitrator. The arbitral proceedings and all pleadings and written evidence shall be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English shall be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. Actions initiated by either party to this Agreement for injunctive relief to enforce its rights or any dispute or claim arising in connection with this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration, shall be heard and determined in any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. The parties expressly and irrevocably consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of any of such Delaware courts in any such action or proceeding; and (ii) waive any claim or defense in any such action or proceeding based on any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens or any similar basis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Class Action Waiver. </strong>Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and StackAware specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other. </strong>You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.</p></li><li><p><strong>General Terms.</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you. We may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible.
